Description​ :


Create a RESTful API for movies (something similar to IMDB).
For this we would like you to use:
● MySql or SQLlite or MongoDB to store data
● Any of the following Python Framework for implementing the APIs.
○ Flask
○ Sanic (preferred)
○ FastAPI
● There need to be 2 levels of access:
○ admin = who can add, remove or edit movies.
○ users = who can just view the movies.
